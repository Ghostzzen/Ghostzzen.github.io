		<head> <b> Ghostzz Life </b> </head>
	<p> Hello there, you are probably wondering, why did Ghostzz make this site and why am I looking at it. </p>
	<p> My story starts off with me being born. I was born. duh
		Lets flash foward 4 years, its almost christmas, and I contracted something that no one expected to be deadly. At that time it was
		pnemoniua, but no one knew, they thought it was just a cold. </p>
		<p> Well it obviously wasnt, day before christmas eve i get sent to the hospital, it spread to my lungs, into my bloodsteam.
			it was <b> BAD </b> </p>
			<p> I had many tests done on me, I was going to die. I <b> was dying. in pain. in front of my family. </b> </p>
			<p> man im tearing up over this shit, i almost died. man, i wouldnt be here rn. imagine that, ha. </p>
			<p> Eventually, thanks to the good doctors, i survived. After that i returned home after being in that hospital for 1 week. </p>
			<p> there were some presents from "santa" and one of them was the Wii, the Wii changed my life, A LOT. </p>
			<p> You see, the wii was my first ever game console, and it was very special because i never had one before. </p>
			<p> the first wii game i ever played was MKWII I got ADDICTED to this game, and still am to this day!</p>
			<p> That game made me happy after having to endure a week of pain and possiblity of death. </p>
			<p> anyways. the wii also inspired another thing, modding and the curiostity of technology. </p>
			<p> I was always intrigued by the hackers and cheaters on the Mario Kart Wii online play MM, so i thought to myself, how are they doing this? </p> 
		        <p> so that was the main reason why i started pursuing computer science and stuff like that. </p>
		     <head> Before Roblox </head>
		<p> Calm down! I know you wanna see my roblox story and how i became protosmasher support blah blah blah, but first I need to tell you guys a story about a time before I played RBLX </p>
		<p> Before Roblox, i would play a lot of other games, these were Minecraft, Mario Bros franchise games and others. </p>
		<p> If your asking, "Did you ever cheat in those games?" You damn right if anything. </p>
		<head> <b> Roblox </b> </head>
		<p> Yeah yeah i know you are saying that im rushing this, I am. hahahah </p>
		<p> this part, i will take into my heart tho, like my almost death story. </p>
		<p> see, roblox has been also special, and thats because the idea of imagination (ish) enviroment. </p>
		<p> I made my first roblox account in 2016 named "PHOENIX_000X" which is still my main account to this day. </p>
		<p> One of my old friends introduced me to Roblox and i quicky realized how cool it was anyone could make a game and publish it. </p>
		<p> I played Roblox like any other, played obbys, tycons, simulators all that jazz. But back in 2017, I heard of exploiting. <p>
			<p> You can already tell where this is going... <p>
		<head> <b> Exploting and ME!</b> </head>
			<p> One of my friends introduced me to the world of exploting, he had a dll named "Spear" i think it was called. It was a free exploit that you inject using a free injector. </p>
			<p> I dont remember much of it, but after 2018 rolled along, I didnt really care for exploiting as much I did back in 2017. </p>
			<p> Then, out of nowhere, my friend introduces me to exploting once again! (same friend) </p>
			<p> The time was around January, and thats when he introduced me to the world of paid exploits. </p>
			<p> See, at the time, I couldnt afford anything, I was broke like a bitch. </p>
			<p> I tried every free exploit out there, eventually leeading to Trigon, which is where I first became a known person in this community (for some wrong reasons hahah) </p>
			<p> see, i was in their discord, and I was browsing the script channel and then I got falsely convicted of speaking in it (which was against the rules) </p>
			<p> I was mad that i couldnt access scripting, so then i took it STRAIGHT to the admin who did it and flamed with him, he eventually gave in hahah. </p>
			<p> Flashfoward to March, I offcially join ProtoSmasher as a active non buyer scrub, and I quickly became familiar and friends with alot of the people I still know on that server to this day. </p>
			<p> However, it wasnt till June when I bought ProtoSmasher, and then thats when I became support. </p>
			<p> Before that, Id like to list all of the friends I met and still talk to and that I am very thankful to have. </P>
				            <p> Flusky, for being a god tier support manager and staff member, and being a kind hearted and awesome person to talk to. </p>
										<p> Roses, for being a good Roblox exploiter and Minecraft cheater (yes I know your secrets) and a good friend and staff member </p>
										<p> Pet, for being super funny and a good friend. </p>
										<p> Legend, for being a good, mature staff member and friend to me. </p>
										<p> Willu for always playing CBRO with me and a funny person. </p>
										<p> Diavolo, even though I just started really talking with you in voice chat and stuff you seem cool so your on here haha. </p>
										<p> Suskii for being a good person and a pretty nice guy to talk to. </p>
										<p> 508Droid, IRL friend and the person who introduced me to Proto and exploting. </p>
										<p> ecez, for being a good support manager and for being one of the first people i talked to on here </p> 
										<p> AppleZ (now Sbeve but heh) for being a very funny person and the first person i talked on here. </p> 
										<p> Applebee, for being a techie dude like me and for being a good friend when I first joined (glad you are back!) </p>
										<p> Slam, good ex staff and support member and funny person. </p>
										<p> Ringrang, for being VERY smart and talented and a funny and chill person to rant and talk to </p>
										<p> Blobbylord, fellow exploiter and IRL friend. Thanks for being here all the way in school and in discord </p>
										<p> Litterally everyone I met and am still friends with along the way. </p>
			<p> Okay, now with all of that out of the way.. </p>
			<p> Lets go onto my ProtoSmasher Support story. </p>
			<p> I have always been an active member since the day I joined, I didnt know alot about exploiting to, wack. </p>
			<p> If you were here from the start, you probably remembered I was a scrub, I didnt even reveal my voice until like June. Crazy. </p>
			<p> I was very insecure when I joined, yeah I know its just a online chatroom about lego hacks but I wanted to seem normal and fit in with everyone else. </p>
			<p> I did know alot about computers and some computer languages, but none of that would apply to Roblox Exploting. </p>
			<p> I only knew Python, HTML, and CSS at the time. I BARELY knew any C#. Not to mention I had no idea on how Roblox even worked. </p>
			<p> So thats when I made a goal to learn everything about Roblox, how it works, and even learn some RLua and C Languages along the way. </p>
			<p> I would help people here and there with ProtoSmasher and basic computer stuff, I felt that I was finally feeling like I belonged here. </p>
			<p> Then one day in June, Support Apps were uploaded. At the time, I already bought ProtoSmasher and Synaspe and felt very prepared for it, considering I was very active and I knew A LOT about Proto and stuff. </p>
			<p> So I applied, and waited. Not even 10 minutes later Sbeve promoted me to support, I was so happy. </p>
			<p> I strived to become the best support, and I felt like I was pretty good, obviously not the best but, you know. </p>
			<p> It was actually something to do in the summertime! </p>
			<p> It was like 1 month after being promoted, and I started to feel stress. </p>
			<p> It was the goddamn trial. </p>
			<p> The trial should have NEVER happened, it was a burden to everyone. </p>
			<p> I had to step down, there were so many stupid nonbuyers and just trolls. </p>
			<p> It was sad. </p>
			<p> But after a couple weeks I came back to support, and I still am today. I dont know how long I am going to keep being support however, school is coming up. :( </p>
			<p> Anyways, thats my story, ill keep updating this website and stuff for different reasons, for now, this is it. </p>
			              <header> Contact me on discord: Ghostzz #2702, good bye now. </header>
										<p> i also stole this idea from Flusky and Louka, thanks for the inspiration yall. </p>
